# AI Career Advisor by EPIC BYTES

The Career Advisor AI system is an intelligent, cloud-based system that aims to transform career advising for students and professionals. By using deep learning and natural language generation technologies, the solution will analyze the individual users profile, such as skills, interests, personality, academic background along with real-time job habits and market opportunities. Unlike traditional career advisory tools, which rely on a static test or generic ideas, our AI system can provide actionable, personalized recommendations, career maps which depict the possible pathways alongside a skill gap analysis.

The system includes user-friendly assessments, automated CV and resume application analysis, and a conversational AI chat application for career advice. The system integrates third-party APIs for real-time job listings, learning resources, and professional networks to ensure that users receive up to date information on job opportunities, skills required, and job market gaps. The system's self-automated engine will change, as users make their journey and as the job market and industry changes, so too can the advice and recommendations.

By automating the career mapping process, while continuously updating options, the system assists in empowering users and their able to make informed, future-fit decisions about their career development. Its holistic, data-driven, user-centered approach allows users to bridge aspirations with market/job realities and provide potential investment in greater satisfaction and success within an competitive marketplace.
